# parenthesis-matcher

Write a function that given a string with parenthesis and a the position
of an opening parenthesis, finds the corresponding closing parenthesis.

Example: Given the string `Sometimes (when I nest them (my parentheticals) too much (like this (and this))) they get confusing.`
and number `10` (position of the first parenthesis), the output should be 79 (position of the last parenthesis).
